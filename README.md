A simple 2D space shooter clone made while learning the basics of Unity 3D

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Unity 3D 4.6.2

### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game is an endless survival shooter where you must fend off waves enemy ships by killing them and gaining points
* The player is also constantly under attck from the enemy ships amd has a max health of hundred before he dies.


## What I learnt while building this game

I learnt how to use animations to make the wave of enemy ships more dramatic.

I learnt how the layer the collisions so that the enemies don't eliminate each other if their bullet happens to hit a team-mate.

I learnt how to build an application for the mobile and use the various inbuilt sensors like the accelerometer.

I also learnt how to show the score of the player after he dies on the next scene.

## Deployment

The game is being built for the mobile but the code can be altered to be built for desktop systems.
